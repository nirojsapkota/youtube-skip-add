# youtube-skip-add Chrome extension
This is not an extension to avoid displaying advertisement but rather will automatically trigger "skip add" click. I am lazy to keep on pressing "Skip Add" while watching youtube videos and NO i don't have paid subscription to youtube. This is why i spent couple of hours to create this plugin FOR SELF.
